# Project Management Web Application with Docker Containerization

## Overview

This project aims to develop a minimal viable product (M.V.P.) of a project management web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Docker. The web application allows users to efficiently create, manage, and track their projects and tasks. Additionally, Docker containerization ensures easy deployment and scalability across different environments.

## Project Structure

The project structure is as follows:

- `index.html`: HTML file containing the structure of the web application.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling the web application.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file for implementing functionality such as adding, marking tasks as done, and triggering confetti animation.
- `Dockerfile`: Dockerfile is used to containerize the web application.
- `README.md`: Documentation explaining how to run the application locally, build the Docker image, and deploy the container.

## Web Application Development

### Features

The web application includes the following features:

- Ability to add new tasks.
- View the list of tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed.

### Implementation

- HTML (`index.html`): Defines the structure of the web application, including input fields and task list.
- CSS (`style.css`): Styles the web application for a better user experience.
- JavaScript (`script.js`): Implements functionality such as adding tasks, marking tasks as completed, and triggering confetti animation.
